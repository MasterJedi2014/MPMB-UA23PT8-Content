# MPMB-UA23PT8-Content
Adds the content from "Unearthed Arcana 2023: Player's Handbook Playtest 8" to the MPMB Character Sheets.

**Script Credit Note:**
A lot of the content of this script is either ripped directly from existing code or is an altered form of existing code. I have tried to diligently note when I copied code from elsewhere, but I probably missed some instances. A lack of note saying I ripped the code from elsewhere either means that I wrote that section of code entirely myself or that the code that was copied to use as a starting point was so heavily altered by me that almost nothing of the copied code exists.
I will note that the Monk class & class options code was done by user "Nod" instead of myself. Much thanks to Nod for providing the code they had already written for the class and making my life easier. I did make some edits to make sure it conformed to the source referencing scheme in the rest of my scripts, but I otherwise left it largely unaltered.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2024-05-22:**
  - Initial upload of script.

**Known Bugs:**
- The Monk subclasses in this article (along with a lot of the subclasses added in this script https://github.com/MasterJedi2014/MPMB-WotC-Subclasses-for-UA-Classes) don't appear in the subclass selection dropdown, but they do appear in the dialog window when the Monk reaches lvl 3 and doesn't pick a subclass with the dropdown. 
- There are other bugs, but almost all of the other bugs are either not hampering sheet functionality or are seemingly rooted in another of my scripts.
